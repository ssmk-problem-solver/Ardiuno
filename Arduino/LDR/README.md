A Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
      works on the principle that its resistnace. A. 
      Inreases with increase in light intensity in an expoential manner.




SIMPLE LDR CIRCUIT:
           Analog Values are Read by the Arduino and coverts to digital with ADC
           I have Included code for one Led to Change the status by Light Intensity
